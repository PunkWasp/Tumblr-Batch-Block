# This is my attempt at a working fork of this extension!

It currently doesn't work, I don't recommend trying to use it. I may or may not be able to get it working again, I make no guarantees.

# Original description

## This extension is no longer being developed.

I am no longer on Tumblr. I apologize for the inconvenience this causes people as Tumblr makes changes that might break TBB.

If anyone wants to continue development for this project, it is licensed as AGPL3 and I would love to see it continue. If you are interested in continuing development of TBB and have questions, feel free to reach out to me at realityfabric@gmail.com.

## Tumblr Batch Block

This extension allows you to block many Tumblr bloggers at a time, and save time doing it. You can input lists you've created yourself, or use lists others have created and shared with you.

### Installation and Use

1. Install Tumblr Batch Block ([Chrome Store link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tumblr-batch-block/kojokoeagiinigcjnggifldgdphhpedh).)

2. Navigate to your [settings page](https://tumblr.com/settings/blog) on Tumblr. (The link will take you to your main blog. You can run the extension from any of your blogs' settings pages.)

3. Click the extension icon. There will be a pop-up box.

#### Blocking

1. Click "Block the List".

2. Enter a comma separated list of blog names (eg "staff, testblog, gettingblocked", sans quotation marks).

3. Leave the tab open until the extension has run through the entire list. You can switch tabs and continue surfing the web while it works.

#### Exporting your blocklist

1. Click "Export Blocklist".

2. Wait for Tumblr Batch Block to collect all of the blogs you have blocked.

3. A text box will appear at the top of the sidebar with a list of blogs you have blocked.
